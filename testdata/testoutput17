/-- This set of tests is for the 16-bit library's basic (non-UTF-16) features

/\x{ffff}/
    A\x{ffff}B
** Character \x{ffff} is greater than 255.
** Because its input is first processed as 8-bit, pcretest does not
** support such characters in 16-bit mode when UTF-16 is not set.
** Truncation will probably give the wrong result.
No match
