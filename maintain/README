The files in the "maintain" directory of the PCRE source contain data, scripts, 
and programs that are used for the maintenance of PCRE, but do not form part of
the PCRE distribution tarballs. There are various file names in the scripts and 
programs; they assume that the pcre directory is current.

132html         A Perl script that converts a .1 or .3 man page into HTML.

Builducptable   A Perl script that creates the contents of the ucptable.h file
                from two Unicode data files, which themselves are downloaded
                from the Unicode web site.
                
CleanTxt        A Perl script that cleans up the output of "nroff -man" by
                removing backspaces and other redundant text so as to produce
                a readable .txt file.
                
Detrail         A Perl script that removes trailing spaces from files.

Index.html      A file that is copied as index.html into the doc/html 
                directory. It works like this so that doc/html can be deleted
                and re-created from scratch.
                
MakeRelease     My script for creating a new release. It processes the 
                documentation man pages into .text and HTML formats before 
                creating tarballs.
                
Tech.Notes      Some notes about the internals of the PCRE code.   
               
Unicode.tables  The files in this directory, Scripts.txt and UnicodeData.txt, 
                were downloaded from the Unicode web site. They contain 
                information about Unicode characters and scripts.

ucptest.c       A short C program for testing the Unicode property functions in
                pcre_ucp_searchfuncs.c, mainly useful after rebuilding the
                Unicode property table.
            
ucptestdata     A directory containing two files, testinput1 and testoutput1,
                to use in conjunction with the ucptest program.
            
utf8.c          A short C program for converting a Unicode code point into a 
                sequence of bytes in the UTF-8 encoding, and vice versa.
                
When there is a new release of Unicode, the files in Unicode.tables must be 
refreshed from the web site, and the Buildupctable script can then be run to 
generate a new version of ucptable.h. The ucptest program can be used to check 
that the resulting table works properly, using the data files in ucptestdata to 
check a number of test characters.
